I'm a software engineer with a passion for React, Redux, JavaScript, Express, Python, and Flask. I am currently working on adding to the current projects that I have been working on that were built with a React/Redux Front-end and Flask-Python back-end.

On a more personal note, I love all things basketball and I can talk about it for way too long. I also have a great appreciation for digital media as an art from videogames to TV, I have strong opinions about them all.

When it comes to software development the part that I most appreciate is the problem solving component that is natural to the field. The challenge of thinking through the logic until the desired solution is found is a really rewarding feeling for me.
